To assure learning, students are required to work, using the SAP ERP software, on a variety of hands-on exercises related to the fictitious bike manufacturer in which they create transactions (e.g. generate a production or purchase order or execute a production plan) that generate an effective and timely flow of information and transactional data across the involved functional areas of the company, which enables the real-time integration of business processes.
